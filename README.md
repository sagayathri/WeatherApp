Weather app using OpenWeatherMap API

Summary: 
 As a part of Android App Development Course, I did this project. Weather App is basically a simple weather forecast android application based on OpenWeatherMap API.  
Description: 

User Interface(UI): 
 Weather App has been designed with the TextViews and an ImageView for displaying the weather icon and a ListView to display the 5 days weather forecast. MenuItems are used to get the input from user in a dialog box. 

Working process: 
 Weather App has been build to fetch the weather forecast from OpenWeatherMap API using unique API key and displays it in the UI. 
 Fetch and parsing the JSON data from OpenWeatherMap API and showed it to the  Weather App UI. 
 
Steps to use the app,
1.	Enter the city name for the weather details.

2.	Weather details of a particular city and next 5 days forecast will be displayed in the app UI.
 
3.	Select “Change city” from the Menulist to change the city name.
 
4.	Select “Refresh” to reload the updated data of the particular city.
