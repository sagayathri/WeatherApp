Weather app using OpenWeatherMap API

Summary: 
 As a part of Android App Development Course, I did this project. Weather App is basically a simple weather forecast android application based on OpenWeatherMap API.  
Description: 

User Interface(UI): 
 Weather App has been designed with the TextViews and an ImageView for displaying the weather icon and a ListView to display the 5 days weather forecast. MenuItems are used to get the input from user in a dialog box. 

Working process: 
 Weather App has been build to fetch the weather forecast from OpenWeatherMap API using unique API key and displays it in the UI. 
 Fetch and parsing the JSON data from OpenWeatherMap API and showed it to the  Weather App UI.
